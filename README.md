# Ambientation Server

**Ambientation**: A groundbreaking fusion of "ambient" and "automation," Ambientation revolutionizes home comfort by dynamically harmonizing lighting, air circulation, and climate controls to create an ideal atmosphere. 

Imagine a home that intuitively senses and adapts to your presence, automatically adjusting lights, fans, and temperature to suit your comfort and energy efficiency—all seamlessly integrated.

## Why Ambientation?

- **Comfort On Demand**: Lights dim, fans adjust, and temperatures set—all as you enter or leave a room.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Reduces waste by intelligently managing utilities based on occupancy and natural light.
- **Adaptive and Personalized**: Customizable for every family member, responding to schedules, preferences, and even moods.

With Ambientation, your home becomes an extension of you, responding automatically to create a seamless, ambient experience that redefines smart living.

## Key Features

- **Plug and Play**: Easy setup with minimal configuration required—simply connect it to your local network, and the Ambientation Server is ready to transform your space.
- **Spotify Integration**: Enjoy seamless music experiences as the server connects to the Spotify platform, adjusting audio based on your movements throughout the house.
- **Scalable and Modular**: Designed for growth, the Ambientation Server can easily accommodate additional features and be optimized for different setups.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core logic for managing automation and server-side operations.
- **Google's MediaPipe**: For real-time face and presence detection to ensure seamless tracking of occupants.
- **Spotify API**: For integrating and controlling music playback.
- **Raspberry Pi/Arduino**: For interfacing with hardware components like lights, fans, and sensors.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ installed on your system.
- A Raspberry Pi or any Linux-based server setup.
- Basic knowledge of your home network configuration.

### Installation

1. **Clone this repository:**
